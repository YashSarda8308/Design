Motivation --> As everything is moving towards Automation we got idea to automate our design works. 
With the help of Python and its modules we are trying to make the tired and time consuming work
easy and finish within just some few minutes.
It is an awesome opportunity to integrate our knowledge of 3 years of engineering with the computer programming.

Softwares used :
1) Python --> Programming Language to develop program.
2) AutoCAD --> To design Machine Elemnts.
3) VS Code --> Visual Studio Code to write Python program.

Modules Used : 
1) Math --> To perform Mathematical Function
2) Matplotlib --> To Plot Graphs, SFD, BMD.
3) Turtle --> A Drawing Module of Python to plot CNC Drawing.
4) Tkinter --> An API to create GUI(Graphical User Interface).
5) PyAutoCAD --> An API to send commands to AutoCAD from Python.

Appln :
1) To make design calculations easy to understand and visualise.

Advantages : 
1) Save time for design.
2) Save time for calculations.

CNC : 
1) Absolute Programming Method --> We used this
2) Incremental Programming Method
